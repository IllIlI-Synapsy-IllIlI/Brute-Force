# Brute-Force
Brute Force for Admin password, you can also add some of your own you want it to test.
To  bypass the admin password.


Step one: open the main .bat file and do what it says. It may ask for your IP and to type in a user.
It depends on the version of your PC. It can also just ask to select a user.


Step two: select a user. If you are trying to hack into the admin and find out its password select admin.


Step three: it asks you to select the passlist so there is a file in this ZIP thats called: passlist.txt
enter this file name and it should start the brute force.



You can also edit the passlist.txt and add passwords that you want it to go trough.
